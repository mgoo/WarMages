# SWEN 222 Group Project  [![pipeline status](https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/swen222-2017-p1-t9/swen222-group-project/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/swen222-2017-p1-t9/swen222-group-project/commits/master)  [![coverage report](https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/swen222-2017-p1-t9/swen222-group-project/badges/master/coverage.svg)](https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/swen222-2017-p1-t9/swen222-group-project/commits/master)

## Installation

Download the repository and checkout this swen221-submittable-base branch. If
you would like to avoid the command line click the green `Clone or Download`
button on Github then `Download ZIP`, otherwise run this from the command line:

    git clone https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/chongdyla/swen222-group-project

### Setup IntelliJ project

- Make sure the Gradle plugin is on:
    - Go to `Settings/Preferences -> Plugins`
    - Then make sure the Gradle plugin is ticked
- In IntelliJ, `Create New Project` (or File > New > Project if inside)
    - Pick Java on the left
    - Click Next, then click Next
    - Select the project location to be inside the repository you have cloned
    - Click Finish
    - At the bottom right, you should get a `Unlinked Gradle project?` message
      (you will probably have to wait a little bit)
        - Click `Import Gradle project`
        - Click OK
- Open the `Gradle` toolbar thing:
    - Should be on an edge of the window
        - If you can't find it, Try pressing `Ctrl+Shift+A` or `Cmd+Shift+A`
          (Mac) then typing `Gradle`. You should see `Gradle`. Pick the one
          that has this [Gradle
          icon](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-fvt5jz8KJ9E/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAc/-dxpnszHExs/photo.jpg)
    - Click the blue refresh button to make IntelliJ load the Gradle stuff (if
      it isn't loading Gradle stuff already)

#### Using the University Computers

Make sure the file doesnâ€™t already exist:

    mv ~/.gradle/gradle.properties ~/.gradle/gradle.propertiesBACKUP

Setup proxy settings:

    ./scripts/install-uni.sh

Running this should not throw errors:

    ./gradlew build

## Structure

Put your java code in `src/main/java/` under the `main` package.

Put your test code in `src/main/java/` under the `test` package.

### Importing Jar files / Libraries

The preferred way to add a library is to add to the `./build.gradle` file.

Put any `.jar` libraries in the `./lib`.

## Running stuff

### Run App

- Select the `App` run configuration
    - Open the `Run Configurations` menu (should be in the top right - it
      should look like a simpler version of
      [this](https://i.stack.imgur.com/UkljJ.png))
    - Click `App`
- Click the debug button (or the run button) the top right

### Running JUnit tests

- Select the `Test` run configuration
    - Open the `Run Configurations` menu (should be in the top right - it
      should look like a simpler version of
      [this](https://i.stack.imgur.com/UkljJ.png))
    - Click `Test`
- Click the red debug button (or the run button) the top right

If you want to run stuff from the terminal, run `./gradlew test` (ignore the
`./` if you are on Windows)

## Submitting assignments

You can export the jar to the `./submit` directory for submitting jars

- If you like the command line:
    - Go into your project directory
    - Run `./gradlew clean submit` (ignore the `./` if you are on Windows)

Then open the `./submit directory`

## Workflow Instructions

Our current workflow will work like this (this is only a summary):

1. Someone creates a new issue (it appears in a backlog)
1. As a team we decide to move issues from the backlog into the TODO list on
   the issues board page
1. Someone decides to pick up the issue, or gets assigned to someone.
1. They will drag the issue into the In Development list and create a branch
1. When they are done they will create are merge request
1. Someone reviews the code in the merge request, and then merges it
1. The reviewer removes the labels from the issue

### Creating A New Issue

1. Go to the issues page and click `new issue`
1. Enter your description and title - ideally include an checklist of things to
   do if there are multiple things to do

You don't need to assign it to anyone. Also, don't assign a label so that the
issue appears in the backlog

### Starting Development (creating a new branch)

1. Under the Board page (under Issues), drag your ticket from the TODO list
   into the In Development list
1. Click the little arrow next to the 'Create Merge Request' button, and click
   the `Create A Branch` button
1. On your computer, run `git fetch --all`, then `git checkout
   your-branch-name`

You can now commit and push to this branch

### Submitting Your Code For Code Review (Creating A Merge Request)

1. Make sure your code is reliable, and the tests and lint/code-analysis pass
   (by either running the `All` build configuration or running `./gradlew
   build` from the command line - replace `./gradlew` with `gradlew` if on
   Windows)
1. Push to the correct branch
1. On the project page there will be a button to `Create Merge Request`. Click
   it
1. Set the template to the `default_merge_request_template`
1. Create your merge request
1. Go to the issues board and drag your ticket over the Code Review list

If don't you want anyone to merge your merge request at the moment, add `WIP`
to the start of the merge request title.

You don't need to set any labels on the merge request, because there are
already labels on the issue.

### How To Do Code Review (NEEDS UPDATING)

1. Find a ticket under the Code Review list in the issues board
1. Open the merge request for this issue
1. Assign the merge request to yourself, so other people know that you are
   reviewing it
1. Have a look at the changes (there's a `Changes` button halfway down the
   page) Look for any:
    - Code styling issues
    - Anything that looks wrong
    - Better solutions to what was written
1. Ensure that all that the required tasks on the issue are done
1. Fetch and check out the branch, run the app, and make sure that everything
   works as intended. Try to break things to be a thorough tester!

If the code is ok, click the merge button, or add a thumbs up reaction to the
merge request and ask someone else to click merge.

If the code is not ok, drag the issue back to the In Development list.

**NOTE: Some of this information has been duplicated in the [merge request
template](./.gitlab/merge_request_templates/default_merge_request_template.md)**

### Code Linting

All java code will be done to the Google Java coding style which can be found
[here](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).

Check the linting by running the `Lint` build configuration in intellij, or by
running `./gradlew lint`.

Setting the default intellij styles will make all the default code completion
be styled correctly and allow you to reformat you code to match the guidelines
(ctrl + alt + L or code > Reformat Code). But dont run this on all code as it
make a large amout of changes just do files you are changing for the issue.
